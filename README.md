## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used CSS custom properties to declare the colors for the project, which was so much easier than having to remember hex or rgb colours. I also used flexbox, which I was already familiar with, for single column layout and grid, which I was less familiar with, to manipulate the cards to display differently on wider screens.

### Continued development

More practise with grid is needed to develop my skills and a better understanding of media queries going forward.

- [w3schools grid tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This helped me to understand grid and get the cards to stack properly when the viewport was wider.
